        "abstract": "In this paper, we present DendroMap, a novel approach to interactively exploring large-scale image datasets for machine learning (ML). ML practitioners often explore image datasets by generating a grid of images or projecting high-dimensional representations of images into 2-D using dimensionality reduction techniques (e.g., t-SNE). However, neither approach effectively scales to large datasets because images are ineffectively organized and interactions are insufficiently supported. To address these challenges, we develop DendroMap by adapting Treemaps, a well-known visualization technique. DendroMap effectively organizes images by extracting hierarchical cluster structures from high-dimensional representations of images. It enables users to make sense of the overall distributions of datasets and interactively zoom into specific areas of interests at multiple levels of abstraction. Our case studies with widely-used image datasets for deep learning demonstrate that users can discover insights about datasets and trained models by examining the diversity of images, identifying underperforming subgroups, and analyzing classification errors. We conducted a user study that evaluates the effectiveness of DendroMap in grouping and searching tasks by comparing it with a gridified version of t-SNE and found that participants preferred DendroMap.

        "abstract": "Image collections today often consist of millions of images, making it impossible to get an overview of the entire content. In recent years, we have presented several demonstrators for graph-based systems allowing image search and a visual exploration of the collection. Meanwhile, very powerful visual and also joint visual-textual feature vectors have been developed, which are suitable for finding similar images to query images or according to a textual description. A drawback of these image feature vectors is that they have a high number of dimensions, which leads to long search times, especially for large image collections. In this paper, we show how it is possible to significantly reduce the search time even for high-dimensional feature vectors and improve the efficiency of the search system. By combining two different image graphs, on the one hand, an extremely fast approximate nearest neighbor search can be achieved. Experimental results show that the proposed method performs better than state-of-the-art methods. On the other hand, it is possible to visually explore the entire image collection in real time using a standard web browser. Unlike other graph-based search systems, the proposed image graphs can dynamically adapt to the insertion and removal of images from the collection. \u00a9 2022 ACM.",

        "abstract": "Nowadays stock photo agencies often have millions of images. Nonstop viewing of 20 million images at a speed of 10 images per second would take more than three weeks. This demonstrates the impossibility to inspect all images and the difficulty to get an overview of the entire collection. Although there has been a lot of effort to improve visual image search, there is little research and support for visual image exploration. Typically, users start \"exploring\" an image collection with a keyword search or an example image for a similarity search. Both searches lead to long unstructured lists of result images. In earlier publications, we introduced the idea of graph-based image navigation and proposed an efficient algorithm for building hierarchical image similarity graphs for dynamically changing image collections. In this demo we showcase real-time visual exploration of millions of images with a standard web browser. Subsets of images are successively retrieved from the graph and displayed as a visually sorted 2D image map, which can be zoomed and dragged to explore related concepts. Maintaining the positions of previously shown images creates the impression of an \"endless map\". This approach allows an easy visual image-based navigation, while preserving the complex image relationships of the graph. \u00a9 2019 Association for Computing Machinery.",

The keyword-based query paradigm used to search in image collection systems, which has been successful in text retrieval, may not be useful in scenarios where the user does not have the precise way to express a visual query. Image collection exploration is a new paradigm where users interact with the image collection to discover useful and relevant pictures. This paper proposes a framework for the construction of an image collection exploration system based on kernel methods, which offers a mathematically strong basis to address each stage of an image collection exploration system: image representation, summarization, visualization and interaction. In particular, our approach emphasizes a semantic representation of images using kernel functions, which can be seamlessly harnessed across all system components.

Color also plays an important role in human rapid scene recognition. However, previous works often neglect color features. We propose new scene descriptors that preserve the information from coherent color regions, as well as the spatial layouts of scenes. Experiments show that our descriptors outperform existing state-of-the-art approaches. Given the similarity metrics, a hierarchical structure of an image collection can be built in a top-down manner.

        "abstract": "Art historians have traditionally used physical light boxes to prepare exhibits or curate collections. On a light box, they can place slides or printed images, move the images around at will, group them as desired, and visual-ly compare them. The transition to digital images has rendered this workflow obsolete. Now, art historians lack well-designed, unified interactive software tools that effectively support the operations they perform with physi-cal light boxes. To address this problem, we designed ARIES (ARt Image Exploration Space), an interactive image manipulation system that enables the exploration and organization of fine digital art. The system allows images to be compared in multiple ways, offering dynamic overlays analogous to a physical light box, and sup-porting advanced image comparisons and feature-matching functions, available through computational image processing. We demonstrate the effectiveness of our system to support art historians tasks through real use cases. \u00a9 1981-2012 IEEE.",

We present a novel method to generate narrative images with plausible semantic scene structures. To achieve this goal, we introduce a layer graph and a scene graph to represent the relative depth order and semantic relationship between image objects, respectively. We first cluster the input image collection to select representative images, and then we extract a group of semantic salient objects from each representative image. Both layer graphs and scene graphs are constructed and combined according to our specific rules for reorganizing the extracted objects in every image. We design an energy model to appropriately locate every object on the final canvas.

Visualization of statistical results can help identify clusters and anomalies as well as analyze deviation, distribution, and correlation. Furthermore, they can provide visual abstractions and symbolism for categorized data. In this paper, we begin our study of visualization of image statistics by considering visual representations of power spectra, which are commonly used to visualize different categories of images. We show that they convey a limited amount of statistical information about image categories and their support for analytical tasks is ineffective. We then introduce several new visual representations, which convey different or more information about image statistics. We apply ANOVA to the image statistics to help select statistically more meaningful measurements in our design process. A task-based user evaluation was carried out to compare the new visual representations with the conventional power spectra plots. Based on the results of the evaluation, we made further improvement of visualizations by introducing composite visual representations of image statistics.",

This paper focuses on an important problem that is not well addressed by the previous methods: visualizing image collections into arbitrary layout shapes while arranging images according to user-defined semantic or visual correlations (e.g., color or object category). To this end, we first propose a property-based tree construction scheme to organize images of a collection into a tree structure according to user-defined properties. In this way, images can be adaptively placed with the desired semantic or visual correlations in the final visualization layout. Then, we design a two-step visualization optimization scheme to further optimize image layouts. As a result, multiple layout effects including layout shape and image overlap ratio can be effectively controlled to guarantee a satisfactory visualization. Finally, we also propose a tree-Transfer scheme such that visualization layouts can be adaptively changed when users select different 'images of interest.' We demonstrate the effectiveness of our proposed approach through the comparisons with state-of-The-Art visualization techniques. \u00a9 2013 IEEE.",

        "abstract": "Most approaches to image retrieval on the web have their basis in document search techniques. Images are indexed based on the text that is related to the images. Queries are matched to this text to produce a set of search results, which are organized in paged grids that are reminiscent of lists of documents. Due to ambiguity both with user-supplied queries and with the text used to describe the images within the search index, most image searches contain many irrelevant images distributed throughout the search results, and are often focused on the most common interpretation of the query. We propose a method for addressing these problems in which conceptual query expansion is used to generate a diverse range of images, and a multi-resolution extension of a self-organizing map is used to group visually similar images. The resulting interface acts as an intelligent search assistant, automatically diversifying the search results and then allowing the searcher to interactively highlight and filter images based on the concepts, and zoom into an area within the image space to show additional images that are visually similar. Evaluations show that the precision of the image search results increase as a result of concept-based focusing and filtering, as well as visual zooming operations, even for uncommon interpretations of ambiguous queries. \u00a9 2011 Springer-Verlag.",

As a result, this technique highlights association rules so that users can discover important relationships between real and categorical variables in multidimensional datasets. This paper introduces an application of the presented technique to painting image collections.

        "abstract": "We present an approach for generating pictorial storylines from large collections of online photo streams shared by visitors to theme parks (e.g. Disneyland), along with publicly available information such as visitor's maps. The story graph visualizes various events and activities recurring across visitors' photo sets, in the form of hierarchically branching narrative structure associated with attractions and districts in theme parks. We first estimate story elements of each photo stream, including the detection of faces and supporting objects, and attraction-based localization. We then create spatio-temporal story graphs via an inference of sparse time-varying directed graphs. Through quantitative evaluation and crowdsourcing-based user studies via Amazon Mechanical Turk, we show that the story graphs serve as a more convenient mid-level data structure to perform photo-based recommendation tasks than other alternatives. We also present storybook-like demo examples regarding exploration, recommendation, and temporal analysis, which may be most beneficial uses of the story graphs to visitors. \u00a9 2015 ACM.",

        "abstract": "The selection of canonical images that best represent a scene type is very important for efficiently visualizing search results and re-ranking them. The canonical images can be obtained using various aspects including viewpoint, visual features, and semantics. Here, we propose the selection of canonical images based on human affects. The proposed method is performed using three steps: extract the affective features from the input image, cluster images in the affective space and rank the clusters, and find representative images within each cluster. First, the probabilistic affective model is used to transform the images into the affective space. Thereafter, the images are clustered in the affective space. Then, the selected canonical images are representative and distinctive from each other. Thus, we define three prominent properties that an informative summary should satisfy: coverage, affective coherence, and distinctiveness. Based on these, cluster ranking is performed. Finally, the representative images for each cluster are selected, all of which are displayed as canonical images to the user. Experiments using web image databases demonstrate are not only representative but also exhibit a diverse set of views with minimal redundancy. \u00a9 2015 IEEE.",

        "abstract": "The objective of hybrid image summarization is selecting a few visual exemplars and semantic exemplars of a large-scale image collection and organizing them to represent the collection. In this paper, we present a framework for hybrid image summarization in which social images and corresponding textual information are taken as vertices in a hypergraph and the task of image summarization is formulated as the problem of hypergraph partition. A generalized spectral clustering technique is adopted to solve the hypergraph partition problem. Besides, we design two representativeness score functions to select the visual exemplars and semantic exemplars. The main advantages of the proposed approach are two-fold: (1) the hypergraph framework takes advantage of homogeneous correlations within images and tags, respectively, as well as heterogeneous relations between them, this characteristic enhances the summarization performance; and (2) we take both visual and semantic representativeness into count to select exemplars, so that the image-tag exemplars are more representative for each cluster. The experimental comparisons to the other method are conducted on some common queries for a real internet image collection. User-based evaluation demonstrates the effectiveness of the proposed approach. \u00a9 2013 Elsevier B.V.",

However, due to the heterogeneous nature of such social media streams, these efforts have not reached fruition. In this paper, we investigate how images can be used as a source for summarising events. Existing approaches have considered only textual summaries which are often poorly written, in a different language and slow to digest. Alternatively, images are \"worth 1,000 words\" and are able to quickly \\& easily convey an idea or scene. Since images in social media can also be noisy, irrelevant \\& repetitive, we propose new techniques for their automatic selection, ranking and presentation. We evaluate our approach on a recently created social media event data set containing 365k tweets and 50 events, for which we extend by collecting 625k related images. By conducting two crowdsourced evaluations, we firstly show how our approach overcomes the problems of automatically collecting relevant and diverse images from noisy microblog data, before highlighting the advantages of multimedia summarisation over text based approaches.

The resulting summary consists of a set of frequent subgraphs describing the underlying patterns of the image dataset.

        "abstract": "Summarization is a challenging task that aims to generate a summary by grasping common information of a given set of information. Text summarization is a popular task of determining the topic or generating a textual summary of documents. In contrast, image summarization aims to find a representative summary of a collection of images. However, current methods are still restricted to generating a visual scene graph, tags, and noun phrases, but cannot generate a fitting textual description of an image collection. Thus, we introduce a novel framework for generating a summarized caption of an image collection. Since scene graph generation shows advancement in describing objects and their relationships on a single image, we use it in the proposed method to generate a scene graph for each image in an image collection. Then, we find common objects and their relationships from all scene graphs and represent them as a summarized scene graph. For this, we merge all scene graphs and select part of it by estimating the most common objects and relationships. Finally, the summarized scene graph is input into a captioning model. In addition, we introduce a technique to generalize specific words in the final caption into common concept words incorporating external knowledge. To evaluate the proposed method, we construct a dataset for this task by extending the annotation of the MS-COCO dataset using an image retrieval method. The evaluation of the proposed method on this dataset showed promising performance compared to text summarization-based methods. \u00a9 ; 2023 The Authors.",

        "abstract": "Most content summarization models from the field of natural language processing summarize the textual contents of a collection of documents or paragraphs. In contrast, summarizing the visual contents of a collection of images has not been researched to this extent. In this paper, we present a framework for summarizing the visual contents of an image collection. The key idea is to collect the scene graphs for all images in the image collection, create a combined representation, and then generate a visually summarizing caption using a scene-graph captioning model. Note that this aims to summarize common contents across all images in a single caption rather than describing each image individually. After aggregating all the scene graphs of an image collection into a single scene graph, we normalize it by using an additional concept generalization component. This component selects the common concept in each sub-graph with ConceptNet based on word embedding techniques. Lastly, we refine the captioning results by replacing a specific noun phrase with a common concept from the concept generalization component to improve the captioning results. We construct a dataset for this task based on the MS-COCO dataset using techniques from image classification and image-caption retrieval. An evaluation of the proposed method on this dataset shows promising performance. \u00a9 2023, The Author(s), under exclusive license to Springer Nature Switzerland AG.",

This provides new value to users, as well as an engaging way for people (especially children) to experience their own photographs. We use a graph model to represent an artist-generated story, where each node is a \u2018frame\u2019, akin to frames in comics or storyboards. A node is described by story elements, comprising actors, location, supporting objects and time. The edges in the graph encode connections between these elements and provide the discourse of the story. Based on this construction, we develop a constraint satisfaction algorithm for one-to-one assignment of nodes to photographs. Once each node is assigned to a photograph, a visual depiction of the story can be generated in different styles using various templates. We show results of several \ufb01ctional visual stories created from different personal photo sets and in different styles.",

Many works in the literature have addressed the indexing of large image collections for search purposes. However, there is a lack of support for exploratory data mining. One May want to wander around the images and experience serendipity in the exploration process. Thus, effective paradigms not only for organising, but also visualising these image collections become necessary. In this article, we present a study to jointly index and visualise large image collections. The work focuses on satisfying three constraints. First, large image collections, up to million of images, shall be handled. Second, dynamic collections, such as ever-growing collections, shall be processed in an incremental way, without reprocessing the whole collection at each modification. Finally, an intuitive and interactive exploration system shall be provided to the user to allow him to easily mine image collections. To this end, a data partitioning algorithm has been modified and proximity graphs have been used to fit the visualisation purpose. A custom web platform has been implemented to visualise the hierarchical and graph-based hybrid structure. The results of a user evaluation we have conducted show that the exploration of the collections is intuitive and smooth thanks to the proposed structure. Furthermore, the scalability of the proposed indexing method is proved using large public image collections. \u00a9 2018 ACM.",

Our approach is based on the random walk with restarts over a graph that models relations between images, visual features extracted from them, associated text, as well as the information on the uploader and commentators. In addition to introducing a novel edge weighting mechanism, we propose in this paper a simple but effective scheme for selecting the most representative and diverse set of images based on the information derived from the graph. We also present a novel evaluation protocol, which does not require input of human annotators, but only exploits the geographical coordinates accompanying the images in order to reflect conditions on image sets that must necessarily be fulfilled in order for users to find them representative and diverse.

The approach is grounded in insights about how people summarize image collections. We utilize the Amazon Mechanical Turk crowdsourcing platform to obtain a large number of manually created visual summaries as well as information about criteria for image inclusion in the summary. Based on these large-scale user tests, we propose an automatic image selection approach, which jointly utilizes the analysis of image content, context, popularity, visual aesthetic appeal as well as the sentiment derived from the comments posted on the images. In our approach we do not describe images based on their properties only, but also in the context of semantically related images, which improves robustness and effectively enables propagation of sentiment, aesthetic appeal as well as various inherent attributes associated with a particular group of images. We discuss the phenomenon of a low inter-user agreement, which makes an automatic evaluation of visual summaries a challenging task and propose a solution inspired by the text summarization and machine translation communities.

        "abstract": "The affordability of digital cameras, storage, processors and the advances made in these areas are encouraging people to continuously take hundreds of photos. However, managing the large number of photographs involves arduous tasks such as selecting good quality photos and classifying and labeling each photo. Generally, users put their photos into certain user-designated folders on their local PCs without considering any classified information. One of the main problems related to this management method is that users do not systematically create their photo folders because they are careless and apathetic. This practice results in confusion when the users want to find their photos. One method to overcome this problem is to construct a central photo management system that can manage many photos on the user\u2019s local PC. This paper proposes an integrated photo management system coupled with a database on the web, which provides users with an automated photo clustering and visualization function that allows photo overlaps. The proposed system provides spatial clustering for Nearly Identical Photos, and it places photos with overlaps to improve space efficiency for the user. This system also provides users with a CUDA version of Depth of Field evaluation and blur estimation functions. In order to evaluate our system, we conducted two quantitative experiments relating to space efficiency and clustering correctness. First, we investigate the placed photo areas of ACDSee (grid layout) and our system to evaluate how much screen space is saved by nearly identical photos overlapping. Second, we also calculate the precision and recall of our system and Cooper\u2019s with regard to user-classified photo sets. \u00a9 Springer Science+Business Media, LLC 2012.",

As a result, image collection summarization systems are proposed to provide users with a condense set of summary images as a representative set to the original high volume image set. In this paper, a semantic knowledge-based approach for image collection summarization is presented. Despite ontology and knowledge-based systems have been applied in other areas of image retrieval and image annotation, most of the current image summarization systems make use of visual or numeric metrics for conducting the summarization. Also, some image summarization systems jointly model visual data of images together with their accompanying textual or social information, while these side data are not available out of the context of web or social images. The main motivation of using ontology approach in this study is its ability to improve the result of computer vision tasks by the additional knowledge which it provides to the system. We defined a set of ontology based features to measure the amount of semantic information contained in each image. A semantic similarity graph was made based on semantic similarities. Summary images were then selected based on graph centrality on the similarity graph. Experimental results showed that the proposed approach worked well and outperformed the current image summarization systems. \u00a9 2016, Springer Science+Business Media New York.",

        "abstract": "Summary: Phylogenetic trees with hundreds of thousands of leaves are now being inferred from sequence data, posing significant challenges for visualization and exploratory analysis. Image data supplying valuable context for species in trees (and cues for exploring them) are becoming increasingly available in biodiversity databases and elsewhere but have rarely been built into tree visualization software in a scalable way. Ceiba lets the user explore large trees and inspect image collection arrays (sets of 'homologous' images) comprising mixtures of 2D and 3D image objects. Ceiba exploits recent improvements in graphics hardware, OpenGL toolkits and many standard high-performance computer graphics strategies, such as texture compression, level of detail control, culling, animations and image caching. Its tree layouts can be tuned by user-provided phylogenetic definitions of subtrees. The code has been extensively tested on phylogenies of up to 55 000 leaves and images. \u00a9 The Author 2014.

        "abstract": "Visual information, in particular in form of images, is becoming increasingly important, and consequently efficient and effective tools for managing these rapidly growing collections are highly sought after. Interactive image database browsing systems provide an interesting alternative to retrievalbased approaches as they let the user explore an image dataset in an intuitive fashion. Based on content-based concepts, large image collections are visualised so that visually similar images are located close to each other in the visualisation space. Once displayed, the user can then interactively browse through the image collection. The main approaches to visualising and browsing image collections are mapping-based techniques, which are based on dimensionality reduction, and clustering-based methods, that group similar images together. In this paper, we highlight how these two approaches can be effectively combined to devise an intuitive image database navigation system that has low computational requirements, both offline and online, and organises images based on colour content on a spherical visualisation space while providing hierarchical access to large image datasets. \u00a9 2013 ACM.",

        "abstract": "With the rapid advancement in technology it is easy to take pictures, and easier still to share them with the world at large. In this digital age the image data we have has grown manifold over the past few years. Digital Cameras have allowed the capturing and storing of large number of images highly inexpensive and hence we can't go on a trip without taking several hundreds of photographs. We take repeated shots till we find the perfect one. As a result, in a collection of images we end up having recurring and similar images which we would like to omit. Manually going through such a huge collection and picking out the best images is a highly laborious task. This paper deals with devising a way of summarizing a given collection of photographs to represent a distinct set of representative images. This would save the users a lot of effort while allowing the selection of the best images of the set which also represent the entire set. Here we employ a modified Latent Dirichlet Allocation technique, a generative probabilistic model, to partition the images from a \u2018Bag of words\u2019 representation created using Scale Invariant Feature Transform (SIFT) vectors and then clustering these vectors into bins. We validate the results using subjective analysis based on 3 metrics by the people providing the image collection and also by a more general set of people.",

        "abstract": "Existing tag based social media search engines present search results as a ranked list of images. But, they fail to identify visual, textual and geographical concepts present in query results. In this paper, we present an approach for automatic generation of visual, textual and geographical concept preserving summary of social image search results. For user specified query, search results are collected from popular content-sharing websites such as Flickr. Aim of the algorithm is, to generate representative but diverse summary having a set of images, information about locations-of-interest ( LOI) associated with the query, and a set of tags, describing the context of images. The proposed scheme exploits multiple modalities in order to understand context and content of geotagged social images. We formulate the problem as a graph clustering problem, where nodes are images and edge weight is computed as geo-graphical distance, tag-based similarity between images and visual similarity between images. In order to reduce the computational overhead, we implement late fusion of three different edge weight parameters. An innovative Graph based clustering algorithm using Haversine distance formula is proposed for geo-clustering of images. Performance evaluation is based on intrinsic and extrinsic methods. We also present an evaluation protocol having no human intervention for evaluating coverage of geographical spread of images in the final result and cluster coherence. Through empirical study, we demonstrate the effectiveness of our algorithm against state-of-the-art image search result summarization methods. \u00a9 2016 ACM.",

        "abstract": "On the Internet, images are no longer static; they have become dynamic content. Thanks to the availability of smartphones with cameras and easy-to-use editing software, images can be remixed (i.e., redacted, edited, and re-combined with other content) on-the-fly, allowing a world-wide audience to repeat the process many times. From digital art to memes, the evolution of images through time is now an important topic of study for digital humanists, social scientists, and media forensics specialists. However, because typical data sets in computer vision are composed of static content, there has been limited development of automated algorithms for analyzing remixed content. In this paper, we propose the idea of Motif Mining: the process of finding and summarizing remixed image content in large collections of unlabeled and unsorted data. For the first time, this idea is formalized and a reference implementation grounded in that formalism is introduced. We conduct experiments on three meme-style data sets, including a newly collected set associated with the Russo-Ukrainian conflict. The proposed motif mining approach is able to identify related remixed content that, when compared to similar approaches, more closely aligns with the preferences and expectations of human observers. \u00a9 2023 IEEE.",

We identified images, attributes, and categories as important aspects and integrated these in a system called ICLIC. The system consists of four views that are connected by the selection of images, which is a central action in the approach. By using a minimalist interface with only standard metaphors, users are enabled to use the system in short time.

To lay out images, we introduce iMap, a treemap-based representation for visualizing and navigating image search and clustering results. iMap not only makes effective use of available display area to arrange images but also maintains stable update when images are inserted or removed during the query. We also develop an embedded visualization that integrates image tags for in-place search refinement. To show the effectiveness of our approach, we demonstrate experimental results, compare our iMap layout with a force-directed layout, and conduct a comparative user study. As a potential tool for astronomy education and outreach, we deploy our iMap to a large tiled display of nearly 50 million pixels. \u00a9 The Author(s) 2013.",

While OCR can be used to enable summaries and search functionality to printed modern text, historical and handwritten documents remains a challenge. By segmenting and counting word images, without applying manual transcription or OCR, we have developed a method that can produce word or tag clouds from document collections. Our new tool is not limited to any specific kind of text. We make further contributions in ways of stop-word removal, class based feature weighting and visualization. An evaluation of the proposed tool includes comparisons with ground truth word clouds on handwritten marriage licenses from the 17th century and the George Washington database of handwritten letters, from the 18th century. Our experiments show that image-based word clouds capture the same information, albeit approximately, as the regular word clouds based on text data. \u00a9 Springer International Publishing Switzerland 2015.",

        "abstract": "Image collage is a very useful tool for visualizing an image collection. Most of the existing methods and commercial applications for generating image collages are designed on simple shapes, such as rectangular and circular layouts. This greatly limits the use of image collages in some artistic and creative settings. Although there are some methods that can generate irregularly-shaped image collages, they often suffer from severe image overlapping and excessive blank space. This prevents such methods from being effective information communication tools. In this paper, we present a shape slicing algorithm and an optimization scheme that can create image collages of arbitrary shapes in an informative and visually pleasing manner given an input shape and an image collection. To overcome the challenge of irregular shapes, we propose a novel algorithm, called Shape-Aware Slicing, which partitions the input shape into cells based on medial axis and binary slicing tree. Shape-Aware Slicing, which is designed specifically for irregular shapes, takes human perception and shape structure into account to generate visually pleasing partitions. Then, the layout is optimized by analyzing input images with the goal of maximizing the total salient regions of the images. To evaluate our method, we conduct extensive experiments and compare our results against previous work. The evaluations show that our proposed algorithm can efficiently arrange image collections on irregular shapes and create visually superior results than prior work and existing commercial tools.",

        "abstract": "Interactive visualization of large image collections is important and useful in many applications, such as personal album management and user profiling on images. However, most prior studies focus on using low-level visual features of images, such as texture and color histogram, to create visualizations without considering the more important semantic information embedded in images. This paper proposes a novel visual analytic system to analyze images in a semantic-aware manner. The system mainly comprises two components: a semantic information extractor and a visual layout generator. The semantic information extractor employs an image captioning technique based on convolutional neural network (CNN) to produce descriptive captions for images, which can be transformed into semantic keywords. The layout generator employs a novel co-embedding model to project images and the associated semantic keywords to the same 2D space. Inspired by the galaxy metaphor, we further turn the projected 2D space to a galaxy visualization of images, in which semantic keywords and images are visually encoded as stars and planets. Our system naturally supports multi-scale visualization and navigation, in which users can immediately see a semantic overview of an image collection and drill down for detailed inspection of a certain group of images. Users can iteratively refine the visual layout by integrating their domain knowledge into the co-embedding process. Two task-based evaluations are conducted to demonstrate the effectiveness of our system. \u00a9 1995-2012 IEEE.",

Central to our approach is a unified graph model with heterogeneous nodes and edges to capture the interrelationship among various entities (e.g., users, posts, images, and tags) in online social media. With the graph representation, we then cast the summarization problem as a graph-based ranking problem by identifying the most representative images regarding to an event. The intuition behind our work is that not only can we crowdsource social media users as sensors to capture and share data, but we can also use them as filters to identify the most useful information through analyzing their interaction in the microblogging network. In addition, we propose a greedy algorithm to encourage diversity among top ranked results for the generation of temporal highlights of targeted events. Our approach is flexible to support different query tasks and is adaptable to additional graph entities and relationships. Copyright \u00a9 2015 ACM 978-1-4503-3306-1/15/03 \\$15.00.",

        "abstract": "In this paper, we introduce 11-20 (Image Insight 2020), a multimedia analytics approach for analytic categorization of image collections. Advanced visualizations for image collections exist, but they need tight integration with a machine model to support the task of analytic categorization. Directly employing computer vision and interactive learning techniques gravitates towards search. Analytic categorization, however, is not machine classification (the difference between the two is called the pragmatic gap): a human adds/redefines/deletes categories of relevance on the fly to build insight, whereas the machine classifier is rigid and non-adaptive. Analytic categorization that truly brings the user to insight requires a flexible machine model that allows dynamic sliding on the exploration-search axis, as well as semantic interactions: a human thinks about image data mostly in semantic terms. 11-20 brings three major contributions to multimedia analytics on image collections and towards closing the pragmatic gap. Firstly, a new machine model that closely follows the user's interactions and dynamically models her categories of relevance. II-20's machine model, in addition to matching and exceeding the state of the art's ability to produce relevant suggestions, allows the user to dynamically slide on the exploration-search axis without any additional input from her side. Secondly, the dynamic, 1-image-at-a-time Tetris metaphor that synergizes with the model. It allows a well-trained model to analyze the collection by itself with minimal interaction from the user and complements the classic grid metaphor. Thirdly, the fast-forward interaction, allowing the user to harness the model to quickly expand ('fast-forward') the categories of relevance, expands the multimedia analytics semantic interaction dictionary. Automated experiments show that II-20's machine model outperforms the existing state of the art and also demonstrate the Tetris metaphor's analytic quality. User studies further confirm that II-20 is an intuitive, efficient, and effective multimedia analytics tool. \u00a9 2020 IEEE.",

Most extant methods leverage the contributions of text-to-visual summaries, ignoring the visual contribution to the textual topic. When the tags are weakly labelled, the textual topic cannot accurately reflect the visual summary. To solve this, the authors propose a novel model, joint optimisation of convex non-negative matrix factorisation, which incorporates images and tags in a beneficial way. The objective function contains visual and textual error functions, sharing the same indicator matrix, connecting different modal relations. Then, they propose an iterative algorithm to optimise the proposed model. Finally, they explore the effects of different visual feature representations (e.g. bag-of-words and deep learning) on multi-modal collection summary. Our proposed method is then compared with state-of-the-art algorithms using two multi-modal datasets (i.e. MIRFlickr and NUS-WIDE-SCENE).
